# Introduction to UniAIMS

Welcome to the **Unified AI Materials Science (UniAIMS)** platform. This platform leverages state-of-the-art deep learning to automate the analysis of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) imagery.

## Key Capabilities

*   **Particle Analysis**: Automated detection, segmentation, and size distribution analysis.
*   **Fiber Analysis**: Orientation mapping and diameter estimation for fibrous materials.
*   **Model Training**: Fine-tune base models on your specific instrument data.

## Getting Started

To get started, navigate to the **Dashboard** and select an analysis task, or upload a new data batch in the **Data Board**.
